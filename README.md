## Memory Game

Welcome to Boston Quest! It's just like the game you used to play as a child, only way better! Click the cards to flip them over and find the matching card in as few tries as possible!

### Configuration Instructions
There are 2 provided folders for cards to play with:
- Boston Places (default)
- Boston Colleges

To play with your own custom cards, add your new card folder to the main directory and modify the value of the folder name in `config.py`

#### Easy Reload

If you would like to reload the card folder without relaunching the game, simply do the following:
- Modify `config.py` as mentioned above or create a new one
- Select "Reload Cards" in the GUI and enter `config.py` (or the name of your new config file) in the text field
