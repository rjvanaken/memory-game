## Memory Game

Memory game for my final project for CS 5001
<br>

Welcome to Boston Quest! It's just like the game you used to play as a child, only way better! Click the cards to flip them over and find the matching card in as few tries as possible!

### Configuration Instructions
There are 2 provided folders for cards to play with:
- Boston Places (default)
- Boston Colleges

To change the cards, modify the value in the `config.py` folder to the folder name you would like to play with.

#### Easy Reload

If you would like to reload the card value without relaunching the game, simply do the following:
- Modify `config.py` as mentioned above and save
- Select "Reload Cards" in the GUI and enter `config.py` in the text field
